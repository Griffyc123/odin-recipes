        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 slices</strong> thick slices hearty white bread</li>
            <li><strong>4 teaspoons</strong> butter, softened</li>
            <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> mayonnaise</li>
            <li><strong>4 slices</strong> thin cut bacon</li>
            <li><strong>2-4 pieces</strong> green leaf lettuce</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> perfectly ripe tomato</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Start by frying your bacon. I highly recommend <strong>baking your bacon</strong>.</p>
                <h4><u>How to Bake Bacon</u></h4>
                <p>When the bacon is crispy (but not TOO crispy!) take it out and remove to a paper-towel lined plate. Tear each slice of bacon in half so there are 8 strips. Keep warm until ready to assemble.</p></li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, prepare your bread. Spread both sides of your bread with butter. Place in a skillet over medium heat and toast lightly, it will only take a couple minutes. Flip each piece of bread and toast the other side. Don’t overdo it! You only want a light browning. (Alternatively, you can toast your bread lightly in a toaster and then spread each side with butter). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Wash and dry your green leaf lettuce. Slice your tomato into slices that are about 3/8 inch thick. Place the tomatoes on a paper towel-lined plate so absorb some of the water.</li>
            <li>Assemble your sandwich: Spread about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise on your toasted bread. Top with lettuce fronds. Next add 2 tomato slices that have been sitting on a paper towel for at least a few minutes. Sprinkle your tomatoes with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add all the bacon. You should have 8 half-strips of bacon. Pile ’em on!</li>
            <li>Spread the other piece of toasted bread with mayonnaise or whatever sauce you are using. Top the sandwich and gently press down. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the sandwich in half. This recipe makes 1 amazing sandwich. Eat right away!</li>
